# Network Intrusion Detection Using Naive Bayes

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a probabilistic Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the NSL-KDD dataset. The system classifies network traffic as either Normal or Attack using a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a probability-based intrusion detection system that identifies malicious network traffic using machine learning.

## 📊 Dataset Used
- Dataset: NSL-KDD
- Total Samples: 22,544
- Features: 42 input features
- Output: Binary classification (Normal / Attack)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🧠 Model Used
Gaussian Naive Bayes (Probabilistic Classifier)

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Load Dataset
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Encoding
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training
6. Performance Evaluation

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~79%
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report generated
- Real-time intrusion probability prediction implemented

## 🚀 Future Improvements
